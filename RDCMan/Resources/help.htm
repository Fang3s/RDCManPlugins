    <h1>RDCMan 2.7</h1>
    <p>
      RDCMan manages multiple remote desktop connections. It is useful for managing server labs
      where you need regular access to each machine such as automated checkin systems and data
      centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servers are organized into named groups. You can connect or disconnect to all servers in a
      group with a single command. You can view all the servers in a group as a set of thumbnails,
      showing live action in each session. Servers can inherit their logon settings from a parent
      group or a credential store. Thus when you change your lab account password, you only need to change the password
      stored by RDCMan in one place. Passwords are stored securely by encrypting with either
      CryptProtectData using the (locally) logged on user's authority or an X509 certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      User with OS versions prior to Win7/Vista will need to get version 6 of the Terminal Services Client. You can obtain this from the Microsoft Download Center:
      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=26f11f0c-0d18-4306-abcf-d4f18c8f5df9">XP</a>;
      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=CC148041-577F-4201-B62C-D71ADC98ADB1">Win2003</a>
    </p>
        <p>Upgrade note: RDG files with this version of RDCMan are not compatible with older program versions. Any legacy RDG file opened and saved with this version will be backed up as <i>filename</i>.old</p>

          <li>Better handling of read-only files</li>
          <li>Added <a href="#The_Recent_Virtual_Group">recently used servers</a> virtual group</li>
          <li>New implementation of thumbnail view for more predictable navigation</li>
          <li>Thumbnail view remembers scroll position when changing groups, etc.</li>
          <li>Performance improvements when loading large files</li>
          <li>Allow scale-to-fit for docked servers (Display Settings.Scale docked remote desktop to fit window)</li>
          <li>Allow scale-to-fit for undocked servers (Display Settings.Scale undocked remote desktop to fit window)</li>
          <li>"Source" for inheritance in properties dialog is now a button to open the properties for the source node.</li>
          <li>Focus release pop up => changed to buttons, added minimize option.</li>
          <li>Added command-line "/noconnect" option to disable startup “reconnect servers” dialog</li>
          <li>Session menu items to send keys to the remote session, e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Del</li>
          <li>Session menu items to send actions to the remote session, e.g. display charms</li>
          <li>Domain=&quot;[display]&quot; means use the display name for the domain name.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Bugs fixed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application is now DPI aware</li>
<li>Undocking a server not visible in the client panel resulted in the client not being shown in undocked form.</li>
<li><span class="keys">Ctrl+S</span> shortcut didn’t work at all. It now works and always saves, even if there are no detected changes to the file.</li>
<li>Shortcut keys didn’t work when focus was on a thumbnail.</li>
<li>Add/delete profile in management tab. In same dialog instance, profiles are not updated. Similarly adding a new profile from combo doesn’t update the tab.</li>
<li>Window title was not updated when selected node is removed and no new node selected (open a file, close the file.)</li>
<li>Connect via keyboard didn’t always give focus when it should.</li>
<li>Connected Group would always show itself upon connecting to a machine, regardless of setting.</li>
<li>Selecting a built-in group then hiding via menu option didn’t work properly.</li>
<li>Editing server/group properties did not always mark a file as changed.</li>
<li>Non-changes could result in save prompts at exit. This should no longer happen.</li>
<li>Activating the context menu via the keyboard button was not always operating on the correct node.</li>
<li>Changing a server/group name doesn’t change window title if the server/group is currently selected.</li>
<li><span class="keys">ALT+PAGEUP</span> and <span class="keys">ALT+PAGEDOWN</span> hotkeys were switched. This is fixed for new installs—for existing files you’ll want to change on the <span class="menuitems">[Tools.Options.Hot Keys]</span> tab.</li>
<li>/reset command line option wasn’t resetting all preferences</li>
<li>“Server Tree” option from “Select server” focus release dialog didn’t show the server tree if it was hidden.</li>
<li>New file directory now defaults to “Documents”.</li>
<li>ListSessions dialog sometimes popped up in a weird location. Now placed within the main window.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="The_Display">The Display</h2>
    <p>The Remote Desktop Connection Manager display consists of the menu, a tree with groups of servers, a splitter bar, and a client area.</p>
    <div class="detail">
      <h3 id="The_Menu">The Menu</h3>
      <p>There are several top-level menus in RDCMan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">File</span> - load, save, and close RDCMan file groups
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">Edit</span> - add, remove, and edit the properties of servers and groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">Session</span> - connect, disconnect and log off sessions
        </li>
        <li><span class="menuitem">View</span> - options to control the visibility of the server tree, virtual groups and size of the client area</li>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">Remote Desktops</span> - allows access to the groups and servers in a hierarchical
          fashion, similar to the server tree; primarily useful when the
          Server Tree is hidden
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">Tools</span> - change application properties
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="menuitem">Help</span> - learn about RDCMan (you probably already found this)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="The_Tree">The Tree</h3>
      <p>
        Most work, such as adding, removing, and editing servers and
        groups, can be accomplished via right-clicking on a tree node. Servers
        and groups can be moved using drag-and-drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keyboard shortcuts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="keys">Enter</span>: Connect to selected server.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="keys">Shift+Enter</span>: Connect to the selected server using the <a href="#Connect_As">Connect As</a> feature.
        </li>
        <li><span class="keys">Delete</span>: Remove selected server or group.</li>
        <li><span class="keys">Shift+Delete</span>: Remove selected server or group without question.</li>
        <li><span class="keys">Alt+Enter</span>: Open properties dialog for selected server or group.</li>
        <li><span class="keys">Tab</span>: If a connected server is selected, give it focus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use the <span class="menuitem">[View.Server tree location]</span> menu option to locate the tree at the left or right edge of the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server tree can be docked, auto-hidden, or always hidden via the <span class="menuitem">[View.Server tree
        visibility]</span> menu option. When the server tree is not displayed, servers can still be accessed
        through the Remote Desktops menu. When the tree is auto-hidden, the splitter bar remains
        visible at the left side of the window. Hovering over it will bring the server tree back
        into view.
      </p>
      <h3 id="The_Client_Area">The Client Area</h3>
      <p>
        The client area display depends on the node selected in the tree. If a server is selected,
        the client area shows the remote desktop client for that server. If a group is selected, the
        client area shows a thumbnail of the servers within that group. The size of the client area
        can be specified via the View menu, as well as resizing the RDCMan window. Use <span class="menuitem">[View.Lock window size]</span> to
        prevent the window from being resized by dragging the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <span style="color: red;">
            Caution: Connected servers can receive focus from keyboard navigation of the thumbnail view. It is not always obvious which
            server has focus, so be careful. There is a setting to control this: <span class="menuitem">[Display Settings.Allow thumbnail session interaction]</span>.
          </span>
        </b>
      </p>
      <h3 id="Full_Screen_Mode">Full Screen Mode</h3>
      <p>
        To work with a server in full screen mode, select the server to give it focus and press <span class="keys">Ctrl+Alt+Break</span> (this key is configurable, see <a href="#Shortcut_Keys">Shortcut Keys</a>.) To leave
        full screen mode, press <span class="keys">Ctrl+Alt+Break again</span> or use the minimize/restore buttons in the connection title bar. Multiple monitors can be spanned
        if enabled by the <a href="#Monitor_Spanning">monitor spanning</a> option.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Shortcut_Keys">Shortcut Keys</h3>
      <p>You can find the full list of Terminal Services shortcut keys <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383500(VS.85).aspx">here</a>. Some of these can be configured from the <a href="#Hot_Keys">Hot Keys</a> tab.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="Files">Files</h2>
    <p>
      The top-level unit of organization in RDCMan is a remote desktop file group. File groups are collections of <a href="#Groups">groups</a> and/or <a href="#Servers">servers</a> that are stored
      in a single physical file. Servers can't live outside of a group and groups can't live outside of a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      A file has all the characteristics of a server group other than being able to change its parent.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Groups">Groups</h2>
    <p>
      A group contains a list of servers and configuration information such as logon credentials. Configuration settings can be inherited from another group or the application <a href="#Default_settings">defaults</a>.
      Groups can be nested but are homogenous: a group may either contain groups or servers, but not both. All the servers in a group can be connected or disconnected at once. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When a group is selected in the tree view, the servers underneath it are displayed in a
      thumbnail view. The thumbnails can show the actual server windows or simply the connection status. 
      Global thumbnail view properties can be adjusted via the <span class="menuitem">[Tools.Options.Client Area]</span> tab while group/server-specific settings are in <a href="#Display_Settings">Display Settings</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="detail">
      <h3 id="Smart_Groups">Smart Groups</h3>
        <p>Smart groups are populated dynamically based on a set of rules. All ancestors of sibiling groups of the smart group are eligible for inclusion.</p>
      <h3 id="The_Connected_Virtual_Group">The Connected Virtual Group</h3>
      <p>
        When a server is in the connected state, it is automatically
        added the to Connected virtual group. Servers cannot be explicitly added
        or removed from the Connected group.
      </p>
      <p>The Connected group can be toggled on/off via the View menu.</p>
      <h3 id="The_Reconnect_Virtual_Group">The Reconnect Virtual Group</h3>
      <p>
        There are sometimes situations where a server disconnects and will be intentionally offline
        for an unspecified length of time, e.g. when rebooting after an OS update. When this is the
        case, drag the server in question to the Reconnect group. RDCMan will continually attempt to
        connect to the server until it is successful.
      </p>
      <p>The Reconnect group can be toggled on/off via the View menu.</p>
      <h3 id="The_Favorites_Virtual_Group">The Favorites Virtual Group</h3>
      <p>
        The Favorites virtual group is a flat file of your favorite servers. You can add any server from the server tree. This is helpful
        when you have many servers in the tree and often work with a handful of servers from different groups.
      </p>
      <p>The Favorites group can be toggled on/off via the View menu.</p>
      <h3 id="The_Connect_To_Virtual_Group">The Connect To Virtual Group</h3>
      <p>
      The Connect To Virtual Group contains the servers that are not members of user-created groups. See <a href="#Connect to">Ad Hoc Connections</a> for details.
      </p>
          <p>The Connect To group is visible while ad hoc connections exist and disappears when there are none.</p>
      <h3 id="The_Recent_Virtual_Group">The Recent Virtual Group</h3>
      <p>
      The Recent Virtual Group contains the servers that have been recently accessed.
      </p>
      <p>The Recent group can be toggled on/off via the View menu.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="Servers">Servers</h2>
    <p>
      A server has a server name (the computer's network name or IP
      address), an optional display name, and logon information. The logon information may be inherited from another group.
    </p>
    <div class="detail">
      <h3 id="Adding_Servers_Manually">Adding Servers Manually</h3>
      <p>
        Servers names following a pattern can be bulk added to a group. There are two pattern classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Iteration - {a,b,c} iterates over the comma-delimeted contents.</li>
          <li>Range - [1-5] iterates the numerical range. Prefix the lower bound with 0's to specify the minimum width.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
        <ul>
        <li>server1{a,b,c}: Adds server1a, server1b, server1c</li>
        <li>server[001-15]: Adds server001, server002, ..., server015</li>
        <li>{dca,dcb}rack[1-5]sql[1-2]: Adds dcarack1sql1, dcarack1sql2, dcarack2sql1, ..., dcarack5sql2, dcbrack1sql1, ... dcbrack5sql2</li>
        </ul>
      <h3 id="Importing_Servers_from_a_Text_File">
        Importing Servers from a Text File
      </h3>
        <p>
        Servers can be imported into a group from a text file. The file
        format is simply one server name per line:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dd>Server1</dd>
        <dd>SecondServer</dd>
        <dd>YANS</dd>
      </dl>
        <p>Server names may also be explicitly specified in the dialog.</p>
      <p>
        All servers are imported into the same group with the same preferences. If a server is imported that has the same name as an
        existing server, the existing server's preferences are updated to the new ones.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Connect To">Ad Hoc Connections</h3>
      <p>
        Ad hoc server connections can be created via the <span class="menuitem">[Session.Connect to]</span> feature. These servers will be
        added to the <a href="#The_Connect_To_Virtual_Group">Connect To Virtual Group</a>. From there they can be converted into real servers by moving them to a user-created group. Servers remaining in the Connect To group are not persisted when RDCMan exits.
      </p>

            <h3 id="Session_actions">Session Actions</h3>
        <p>While in a session, the focus can be released to another session or the server tree.<br />
            Focus release left (default value is <span class="keys">Ctrl+Alt+Left</span>) : This selects the previously selected session.<br />
            Focus release right (default value is <span class="keys">Ctrl+Alt+Right</span>): This brings up a dialog to choose where to focus. There will be buttons for up to the of the most-recently used session as well as a button for the server tree and one to minimize RDCMan.
        </p>
        <p>Certain key combinations and Windows actions can be tricky to perform over the remote session--particularly when RDCMan itself is started within a remote session--e.g. <span class="keys">Ctrl+Alt+Del</span>. These are available from the <span class="menuitem">[Session.Send keys]</span> and <span class="menuitem">[Session.Remote actions]</span> menu items.

      The <span class="menuitem">[Tool.Options]</span> menu item brings up the Options Dialog. Global
      settings, e.g. the client area size, are modifiable from here.
      Most server-related options, e.g. hot keys and those on the experience page, will not take effect until the next time that server is connected.

          The main menu can be hidden until the <span class="keys">ALT</span> key is pressed or the window caption area is left clicked.
      </p>
      <p id="Auto_save">
          <span class="setting">Auto save interval</span><br />
          You can have RDCMan periodically save the open files automatically. Check the auto-save
          check box and specify the interval (in minutes) for saving. An interval
          of 0 will not save periodically but will suppress the save prompt when exiting RDCMan.
      </p>
      <p id="Reconnect_at_startup">
          <span class="setting">Prompt to reconnect connected servers on startup</span><br />
          RDCMan remembers which servers where connected when the program was exited. On the next run you are prompted
          to choose which servers to reconnect. Disabling this option automatically reconnects all previously connected servers. See <a href="#Command_Line">Command Line</a> for command line switches that affect this behavior.
      </p>
      <p id="Default_settings">
        <span class="setting">Default group settings</span><br />
        Clicking this button opens a dialog to configure the settings for the base level of the inheritance hierarchy. E.g. if a File group is set to inherit from its parent, this is where the settings come from.

      <h3 id="Tree">Tree</h3>
      <p id="Focus_on_click">
          <span class="setting">Click to select gives focus to remote client</span><br />
          When selecting a node in the server tree control with a mouse click, the default
          behavior is to keep focus on the tree control. There is an option to change this
          to focus on the selected server.
      </p>
      <p id="Dim_when_inactive">
          <span class="setting">Dim nodes when the tree control is inactive</span><br />
         RDCMan can dim the tree control when it is inactive. This presents a more obvious visual distinction of keyboard focus.
      </p>

        <p id="Client_Area_Size">
            <span class="setting">Client Area Size</span><br />
            This option resizes the client area of the RDCMan window. The options are also available from the <span class="menuitem">[View.Client size]</span> menu.
        </p>
        <p id="Thumbail_Unit_size">
            <span class="setting">Thumbnail Unit Size</span><br />
            The thumbnail unit size can be specified as an absolute pixel size or a relative percentage of the client panel width.
        </p>
      <h3 id="Hot_Keys">Hot Keys</h3>
      <p>
        Many of the remote desktop hot keys are configurable. There is a limited mapping, however. For example if the default key is
        ALT-something, the replacement must also be ALT-something. To change a hot key, navigate to the text box for the hot key and press the new "something" key.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Experience">Experience</h3>
      <p>Depending on the bandwidth available from your machine, you will want to limit Windows
        UI features to improve performance. The connection speed drop down can be used to set all
        options together, or they can be individually customized. The features are: desktop
        backgrounds, showing full window contents when dragging, menu and window animation, and
        windows themes.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Full_Screen">Full Screen</h3>

          <span class="setting">Show full screen connection bar</span><br />
          <span class="setting">Auto-hide connection bar</span><br />
          When a server is displayed in full-screen mode, the remote desktop activeX control
          provides a UI connection bar at the top of the window. This bar can be toggled on and
          off. When it is on, you can choose to have it pinned or auto-hidden.
      </p>
      <p id="Topmost">
          <span class="setting">Full screen window is always on top</span><br />
          When RDCMan is displaying a server in full-screen mode, you can choose to have the window always displayed as the top-most window.
      </p>
      <p id="Monitor_Spanning">
          <span class="setting">Use multiple monitors when necessary</span><br />
        By default, a full screen session is restricted to the monitor containing the server
        window. You can enable multiple monitor spanning in the full screen options. If the remote
        desktop is larger than window's monitor, it will span as many monitors as needed to fit the
        remote session.  Note that only rectangular areas are used, so if you have two monitors with
        differing vertical resolutions, the shorter of the two is used.  Also, there is a hard limit
        of 4096x2048 for the remote desktop control.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="Local_Options">Local Options</h2>
    <p>
      Groups and Servers have a number of tabbed property pages with various customization
      options. Many of these pages are common to groups and servers. When the &quot;Inherit from
      parent&quot; check box is checked, the settings that follow are inherited from the parent
      container. Most server-related changes, e.g. remote desktop size, will not take effect until
      the next time that server is connected.
    </p>
    <div class="detail">
      <h3 id="File_Settings">File Settings</h3>
      <p>
        This page only appears for the properties of a <a href="#Files">file</a>. It contains options for the file's group name, shows the full path to the file (which can't be edited), and has a comment field.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Group_Settings">Group Settings</h3>
      <p>
        This page only appears for the properties of a <a href="#Groups">group</a>. It contains options for the group name, parent nesting, and a comment.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Server_Settings">Server Settings</h3>
      <p>
        This page only appears for the properties of a <a href="#Servers">server</a>. It contains options for the server name, its display name, parent nesting, and a comment. SCVMM virtual machines can be connected to via RDP into the host using the <span class="setting">VM console connect</span> option. 
        Be sure to enter the VM host name as the server name. To determine the id corresponding to the VM, open a PowerShell window as Administrator and run the command: <code>get-vm | ft Name,Id</code>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Logon_Settings">Logon Credentials</h3>
      <p>
        The Logon Credentials property page contains options pertaining to
        remote login. The user name, password, and domain are set on this page. The domain and user name can be specified together by
        using the <i>domain\user</i> format.
        When logging in to a machine &quot;domain&quot; rather than a Windows domain, you
        can specify [server] or [display]. This former will be substituted with the server name, the latter with the display name, at
        logon time. It is useful when you have a group of machines which require
        logging in as administrator.
        <span id="Connect_As">
          The Logon Settings entered in the properties pages are used by default for new connections.
          If you want to temporarily customize these settings for a new connection, connect
          using the <span class="menuitem">Connect As</span> menu item.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3 id="Gateway_Settings">Gateway Settings</h3>
      <p>
        The Gateway Settings property page has options for using a TS Gateway Server. The Gateway
        name, authentication method, and local address bypass options are on this page. Users of operating systems starting from
        Vista SP1 and Longhorn server will have additional options regarding logon credentials:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explicit entry of Gateway user name and password</li>
        <li>Ability to share the Gateway credentials with the remote server</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Connection_Settings">Connection Settings</h3>
      <p>The Connection Settings tab includes settings to customize how a session is connected and what happens upon logon.</p>
      <p>You can specify whether the console session should be connected to as well as the remote desktop connection port.</p>
      <p>
        There are also settings that allow you to run a program upon connection. Enter the program
        name and, optionally, the working directory for that program. Note that these only have an
        effect if you are connecting to the console session for the first time. That is,
        reconnecting to a session or connecting to a session other than the console session will not
        run the program. (At least, this is how Terminal Services appears to work based on empirical
        observation.)
      </p>
      <h3 id="Remote_Desktop_Settings">Remote Desktop Settings</h3>
      <p>
        The size of the remote desktop is specified on this page. This is the
        logical desktop size, not the physical client view of it. For example,
        if the remote desktop size is 1280 x 1024 and client size is 1024 x 768,
        you would see a 1024 x 768 view of the remote desktop with scroll bars. If the client
        size were 1600 x 1200, the entire remote desktop would be visible, offset
        by a gray border.
      </p>
      <p>Specifying "Same as client area" will make the remote desktop the same size as the RDCMan client panel, i.e. the RDCMan window client area
      excluding the server tree. Specifying "Full screen" will make the remote desktop the same size as the screen that the server is viewed on.
      Note that the remote desktop size is determined upon connecting to a server. Changing this setting for a connected server will have no effect.</p>
      <p>
        The maximum size of the remote desktop is determined by the version of the remote desktop
        activeX control. Version 5 (pre-Vista) had a maximum of 1600 x 1200; Version 6 (Vista) has a
        maximum of 4096 x 2048. This limit is enforced at connection time, not during data
        entry. This is in case the same RDCMan file is shared by multiple computers.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Local_Resources">Local Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Various resources of the remote server may be delivered to the client. The remote computer
        sound can be played locally, played remotely, or disabled entirely. Windows key combinations
        (for example, those involving the actual Windows key as well as other specials like <span class="keys">Alt+Tab</span>)
        can be applied always to the client machine, always to the remote machine, or to the client
        when windowed and the remote machine when in full screen mode. Client drive, port, printer,
        smart card, and clipboard resources can be automatically shared to the remote machine.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Security_Settings">Security Settings</h3>
      <p>
        You can specify whether authentication of the remote machine is required before a connection is established.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Display_Settings">Display Settings</h3>
      <p>Thumbnail display settings are customizable from this page.</p>
      <p>
        The first option is: thumbnail scale. This specifies how many thumbnail units to allocate to
        the display of a given server.  All servers default to a scale of 1. You can change this to
        increase the display of important servers. For example, a server could be scaled by 3 or 5
        making the remote session quite usable in the thumbnail display while still permitting a
        view of many other servers. This is the only option for servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three additional options for groups: preview session in thumbnail, allow thumbnail session interaction, and show disconnected
        thumbnails. The first whether or not the thumbnail view shows the actual live
        connection, continually updated. The second, dependent on the first, specifies whether the thumbnail session is usable. The final option controls whether disconnected
        servers appear in the thumbnail view.
      </p>
        <h3 id="Encryption_Settings">Encryption Settings</h3>
        <p>RDCMan can encrypt the passwords stored in files either with the local user's credentials via CryptProtectData or an X509 certificate. The <span class="setting">Encryption Settings</span> tab is available in the <a href="#Default_settings">Default Group Settings</a> and <a href="#File_Settings">File Settings</a> dialogs.</p>
        <p>Personal certificates of the current user which have a private key are available for encryption. You can create such a certificate in the following manner:<br />
            <code>makecert -sky exchange -r -pe -a sha1 -len 2048 -ss my -n "CN=MyRDCManCert"</code><br />
            This will create a certificate called "MyRDCManCert" in the Personal Certificates store of the current user. To install this cert on another computer, you must export it with the private key.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Profile_Management">Profile Management</h3>
        <p><a href="Credential_Profiles">Credential profiles</a> can be added, edited, and removed from this tab.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="List_Remote_Sessions">List Remote Sessions</h2>
    <p>RDCMan has limited support for managing remote sessions other than those connected from it. The <span class="menuitem">[Session.List Sessions]</span>
    menu item invokes the feature.</p>
    <p>Note that the account running RDCMan must have Query Information permissions on
        the remote server to list the sessions. Furthermore, the remote session must be directly reachable rather than via a gateway server. Disconnect and Logoff
        permissions must be granted to perform those operations. See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383488(VS.85).aspx">msdn</a> for more information on remote desktop permissions.</p>
    <h2 id="Command_line">Command Line</h2>
    <p>By default, RDCMan will open the files that were loaded at the time of the last program shutdown. You can override this
    by specifying a file (or files) explicitly on the RDCMan command line. Additionally, the following switches are accepted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>/reset - reset the persisted application preferences such as window location and size.</li>
      <li>/noopen - do not open the previously loaded files, starting with an empty environment.</li>
      <li>/c server1[,server2...] - connect specified servers</li>
      <li>/reconnect - connect all servers that were connected at shutdown without prompting</li>
      <li>/noconnect - do not prompt to connect servers that were connected at shutdown</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Find_Servers">Find Servers</h2>
    <p>
       There is a dialog for finding servers accessed via <span class="keys">Ctrl+F</span> or the <span class="menuitem">Edit.Find</span> servers command. All servers matching a regular expression pattern are displayed in the dialog and can be acted on via a context menu.
       The pattern is matched against the full name (group\server.)
     </p>
    <h2 id="Credential_Profiles">Credential Profiles</h2>
    <p>
       Credential profiles store logon credentials globally to RDCMan or in a file. This allows for using the same stored credentials across groups that do not have a common ancestor. One use scenario is to store credentials used for logging into servers and gateways in a single place. When a password changes, it can be edited once.
       Another scenario is when sharing RDG files across a group. Instead of storing passwords in the file (which would have issues due to the user-specific nature of the encryption RDCMan uses), a
       profile is created such as "Me" which each user defines in their Global store.
    </p>
    <p>You can update the settings for a credential profile in two ways. The first is to edit from a credentials dialog and then save the exact same profile name/domain to the same store (file or global). That will ask if you want to update. The other way is to go to the group properties for the credential store (again, file or global) and use the Profile Management tab.</p>
        <p>File scope credential profile passwords are encrypted according to the containing file's <a href="#Encryption_Settings">Encryption Settings</a>. Global credential profiles use the <a href="#Default_settings">Default Group Settings</a>.
            </p>
    <h2 id="Policies">Policies</h2>
