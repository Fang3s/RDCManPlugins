# 5 Best Remote Desktop Connection Managers ([link](https://activedirectorypro.com/rdp-connection-manager/))

*By Robert Allen | April 22, 2018 | 14*

Are you looking for the best remote desktop connection manager?

Then you’re in the right place.

As a System Administrator, it is common to establish multiple RDP connections on a day to day basis. You may also make other daily connections like SSH or telnet to manage and troubleshoot network equipment.

To manually establish these connections over and over again is a major pain.

How many times a day do you enter in your credentials? Somedays I could end up making 50+ connections a day. That’s 50+ times I manually enter in my credentials to make a remote connection.

This is why I started using a remote desktop connection manager.

It saves me time and is much more efficient.

Let’s take a look at some of the best remote connection manager.

## 1. [Remote Desktop Connection Manager (RDCMan)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44989)

RDCMan also called Remote Desktop Connection Manager is a tool by Microsoft that will centralize and group RDP connections.

RDCMan is useful for administrators that need to connect to remote computers or servers on a regular basis. It allows you to save logon credentials which eliminate the need to type in a user name and password on each connection.

This makes it faster when you need to log into multiple servers on a day to day basis.

Additional features include virtual machine connect to console support, smart groups, and credential connection with certificates.

RDCMan has a simple user interface and is very easy to use. You can import servers from a text file, unfortunately, there is no option to import from Active Directory. Seems odd since it’s a Microsoft developed tool.

If you just need an RDP connection manager, then this is a great and easy tool to use. If you need a tool that supports additional protocols then move on.

## 2. [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/)

mRemoteNG is a multi tab remote connection manager. Just like RDCman it is a centralized tool that manages connections to remote systems. mRemoteNG has many features that RDCman does not have such as the ability to manage different connection types.

In addition to RDP, it supports VNC, ICA, SSH, Telnet, RAW, Rlogin and Http/S protocols.

The tab features comes in handy when you open multiple sessions and need to jump back and forth between them.

More features include, easy to organize and maintain a list of connections, store credentials for auto logons, importing from Active Directory, fullscreen mode, allows for grouping and nesting folders and more.

I really like this tool, it is easy to use and has a clean interface. I can group together all server connections and create separate groups for all other types of connections like SSH.

## 5. [DameWare Mini Remote Control](https://www.solarwinds.com/dameware-mini-remote-control/registration?CMP=BIZ-TAD-ADP-SW_WW_X_PP_PPD_FT_EN_DW_SW-MRC-DL_X_X_X-Q218)

## Final Thoughts

Each remote connection manager has its pros and cons. To find what best fits your needs I recommend downloading and trying them out for yourself. I personally use mRemoteNG and Damware mini remote control.

I use MremoteNG to manage RDP server connections and ssh connection to network switches. I like that it has a clean interface its simple to use and is not bloated with extra junk that I don’t need. I can also share the connection file with my team to make the whole team more efficient.

Helpdesk and my team use DamWare to connect to end users desktop and laptops. It allows us to remote shadow end users systems to troubleshoot and assist with any issues they have. With its wide range of features it’s a great tool for end user support.

That’s all. I hope that this list helped you find a remote connection manager for you and your team. You may also want to see check out my list of [Active Directory Tools](https://activedirectorypro.com/tools/).
